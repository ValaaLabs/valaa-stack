# Messy migration matter

This folder (and the containing git branch which shall not be merged
to master to not add confusion) contains unorganized and/or unfinished
infrastructural content, tools and source. Most notably Zero editor
event log and blobs dump is contained inside valaa-zero/partitions.
The new Valaa Technologies repository will reorganize and integrate
some of this material with the valaa stack as part of the open 
sourcing process (which unfortunately wasn't properly finalized in
time before the force majeure).

Thus besides the zero dumps, don't expect to find much of anything that
would be value here.
