/**
 * Resolves the chain of then-operations eagerly ie. synchronously if possible.
 * If any of the intermediate steps is a promise, the whole operation behaves like so:
 *
 * return functionChain.reduce(async (intermediate, f) => f(await intermediate), initialValue)
 *
 * Otherwise thenChainEagerly returns the result synchronously, like so:
 *
 * return functionChain.reduce((intermediate, f) => f(intermediate), initialValue)
 *
 * Additionally, if any of the steps throws (synchronously or asynchronously) the thrown error is
 * wrapped with context information. Additionally if onRejected is given it will be called with
 * the wrapped error and its result value thrown.
 *
 * Rationale: in Valaa codebase there are pathways which sometimes need to work synchronously and
 * sometimes asynchronously, depending on what data can be known to be cached or not.
 * While 'await' keyword can accept non-promise values just fine the issue is that declaring a
 * function to be 'async' means that it will always return a Promise: this means that synchronous
 * callers will be broken. Changing synchronous callers to use await or deal with promises has
 * cascading changes to the surrounding contexts which would lead to larger rewrites.
 *
 * thenChainEagerly solves this problem by retaining the synchronous callsites unchanged with the
 * expense of necessitating the internal sync/async hybrid callpaths to use the somewhat clunkier
 * thenChainEagerly API, instead of the nicer async/await.
 *
 * @export
 * @param {any} head
 * @param {any} callbacks
