# VAlaa Language for Kuerying 

## TODO(iridian): Describe teh language. Also, work remaining:

Implement convenience class properties to JSON-normal form, and implement the kuery system to accept 
the normal form content accordingly. Notably the expression and function normal form is still 
undefined and thus obviously unimplemented.

Flow the whole thing.
