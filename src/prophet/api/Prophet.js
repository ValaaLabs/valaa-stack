   * functionally incomplete event logs, even if event log might be outdated in itself.
   *

   * 1. all events and commands of the optional explicit initialNarrateOptions.eventLog option and
   *    the latest previously seen full narration of this partition in the Scribe (deduplicated)
   * 2. all events in the most recent authorized snapshot known by the remote authority connection
   * 3. all events in the remote authorize event log itself

   * Irrespective of where the first narration is sourced, an authorized full narration is
   * initiated against the remote authority if available.
