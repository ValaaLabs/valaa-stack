# @valos/vault provides `ValOS` - the Valaa Open System

Distributed platform of platforms, with minimal threshold of entry
for creating applications with familiar HTML5/CSS/JS and then
deploying, sharing and reusing not just the applications themselves,
but modules and the content as well, using a unified, powerful
resource model.

## @valos/vault repository in github.com/valaatech/vault

@valos/vault repository has three main roles:

- it is the [monorepo](https://medium.com/@luisvieira_gmr/building-large-scale-react-applications-in-a-monorepo-91cd4637c131)
and the upstream for all the primary `@valos` npmjs.com packages:
`tools`, `raem`, `script`, `prophet`, `engine` and `inspire`.
- it provides a locally deployable, locally restricted but otherwise
complete ValOS Stack for testing and hot-reloading development.
- it provides `@valos/vault` npm package with the shared tools for
creating and managing ValOS deployments in general and
`Inspire Gateway` runtime deployments in specific.


## Local deployment of a restricted ValOS stack

Local development web server can be launched like so:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This launches webpack dev-server at 0.0.0.0:8080 which serves the
`Inspire Gateway` javascript runtime to the client browser accessing
it. The gateway will deliver `Zero Editor` as its `ValaaSpace` entry
site which is sourced locally from `./revelations/local-zero`.


### No remote authority plugins - limited persistence

No remote content can be accessed and all content that is created is
persisted only locally inside the client browser IndexedDB cache.
`ValaaSpace` content will thus survive page refreshes but can still be
unpredictably lost. This can happen for example when the browser
clears its cache for new space.


## Overview

Most of the Valaa infrastructure logic lies within the sub-modules of
the Inspire client javascript runtime which runs in user browsers.

Applications are created on top of this infrastructure in the form of
Valaa resources, which are stored in a globally shared `ValaaSpace`.
In order to efficiently show these applications to the user Inspire
loads only small parts of the whole ValaaSpace (called `partitions`)
inside the user's browser. It accomplishes this using `event streams`.


### Event stream circle of life

Inspire client connects to selected partitions inside remote
`authorities` to receive application and content event streams. It
then locally interprets these events as Valaa resources which contain
the structure, code, UI components and data all together making up the
application. Inspire then renders these to the user as a fully locally
interactive web page.

When user then interacts with the application and makes a modification
which should affect other users, Inspire sends this modification to
the appropriate remote authority as a `command`. The authority can
then authorize this command as a new event as part of its event stream.
When doing so the authority sends the new event to all other clients
who were registered to the content, thus completing the circle.

Everything that happens or is created in ValaaSpace is created using
this cycle. Zero, the primary ValaaSpace content editor, is merely
another Valaa application rendered by Inspire and has indeed been
primarily developed using itself (after a brief bootstrapping phase).


### Backend authorities can be simple

A minimal but complete backend authority needs to be two things:

- An `event sourcing` pub-sub hub and event log provider; to be able
  authorize (or reject) incoming commands into events and then publish
  these to clients who are subscribed to the relevant `partitions`, as
  well as provide full event logs when requested
- An immutable binary hosting provider: to receive blob content which
  is referred to by above events and then later deliver the content to
  clients requesting it.

Backend authorities are allowed and in fact expected to be much more
than this. Nevertheless, when even such minimal authorities are
combined with a way to deliver the Inspire runtime to users this
completes Valaa as a fully self-contained platform.

Note: tools for managing reference authority deplyoments will likely
be contained in a separate repository (as valma).


## Monorepo of primary ValOS packages

For ease of development all primary ValOS packages still exist in the
same repository. Some of them might be gradually separated but as long
as they remain their version numbers will progress in lock-step.

@valos/inspire is the top level entry point of the local development
environment `Inspire Gateway`.

These packages have similarities in their structure. Those extending
the schema provide a root-level ContentAPI.js. Several modules
provide an incremental test harness under */test/*TestHarness.
@valos/tools contains assorted generic tools. All packages share:

- dev-depends: `jest`, `eslint`, `flow`, `babel`, `webpack`, `npm`
- depends: `lodash`, `graphql`, `es5`, `various polyfills`
- concepts: `event sourcing`, `distributed infrastructure`, `es6`


### @valos/raem provides Valaa Resources And Events Model `ValaaRAEM` (/vælɑːɹɛem/)

Provides the central Valaa technologies: the Valaa Resource Model and
the Valaa Event Model. Provides the connection between these in the
form of `reducers` which convert event streams into in-memory Valaa
resources and their updates. Provides schema definitions for `Resource`
and other essential Valaa resource model interfaces. Provides a kuery
language `VALK` for accessing and making limited manipulations to the
resources. Provides the low level APIs for manipulating partitions.
Implements `ghost instancing` for the Valaa resource model;
a generalization extension of the traditional prototypical inheritance
which recursively inherits the sub-components of the prototype as
transparent but selectively modifiable `ghosts`. Provides referential
integrity to the resource model via `couplings`.

- depends: `@valos/tools`, `immutable`
- exports: `Corpus`, `Command`, `VALK`, `RAEMContentAPI`
- ValaaSpace: `Resource`, `ResourceStub`, `Blob`, `Partition`
- concepts: `ghost instancing`, `partitions`, `couplings`


### @valos/script extends Javascript with ValaaRAEM as `ValaaScript`

ValaaScript is a semantic, non-syntactic extension of Javascript which
seamlessly integrates Valaa resources with the Javascript object model.
Bridges the gap between Javascript model and ValaaRAEM by considerably
extending the schema. Provides an implementation for ValaaScript via
transpiling into VALK kueries as an intermediate language.

- depends: `@valos/raem`, `acorn`
- exports: `transpileValaaScript`, `VALSK`, `ScriptContentAPI`
- ValaaSpace: `Scope`, `Property`
- concepts: `ECMAScript2015`, `scope`, `transpilation`


### @valos/prophet provides ValaaRAEM stream components

Provides event stream connectivity. This is not just to remote
authorities but also to local browser `IndexedDB` storage. Provides
a non-authoritative in-memory repository `FalseProphet`, which wraps
@valos/raem and @valos/script. Provides command queueing and reformation
capabilities. Provides a client-side `ACID` `transaction` framework
with transparent ValaaScript integration. Provides blob content
caching and management pathways. Extends the schema with folder-like
structure as well as relation-like connectivity. Together these
provide fully offline mode readiness. Provides the backend event
stream  connectivity reference implementation with AWS using simple
REST lambdas and the AWS mqtt IoT as event pub-sub.

- depends: `@valos/script`, `IndexedDB`, `AWS IoT/S3/DynamoDB`
- exports: `FalseProphet`, `PartitionConnection`, `ProphetContentAPI`
- ValaaSpace: `Relatable`, `Entity`, `Media`, `Relation`,
- concepts: `ACID`, `authorities`, `pub-sub`, `offline readiness`


### @valos/engine provides the ValaaRAEM object mapper and computation engine

Provides the live proxies (`Vrappers`) to ValaaSpace resources with
`ValaaEngine`. Completes the modifcation and transaction frameworks
with the ability to create commands with the proxy objects. Provides
Media content decoder framework, which allows converting
ValaaScript content inside ValaaSpace into executable code. This also
allows integrating existing javascript code through ValaaScript
seamless integration. Converts events into subscriber callbacks calls.
Together these enable fully live-updating ValaaScript code via VALK
kueries as intermediate language. Exposes ValaaScript standard API
into ValaaSpace as `Valaa` execution environment global scope
primitive, with which ValaaScript programs have full control over
computation, stream connectivity and rendering environment inside the
browser.

- depends: `@valos/prophet`
- exports: `ValaaEngine`, `Vrapper`, `VALEK`
- ValaaSpace: `Valaa.*`, `Object integration`
- concepts: `live kuery`, `code-as-content`, `3rd party libraries`


### @valos/inspire provides the ValOS browser gateway and DOM UI renderer

Provides the runtime entry point and UI rendering integration using
`React`. Sets up the full ValaaStack. Manages initial authentication
and connects to the entry partition. Sets up the rendering module,
attaches it to DOM and renders the entry partition `LENS`. Renders
resources using attached `lens` Media files. Introduces a Media type
`VSX` (similar to `JSX`) specifically for this purpose, which allows
writing natural HTML but also embedding it with fully live ValaaScript
snippets. With promise-enabled rendering enables fully dynamic
ValaaSpace integration with the UI.

- depends: `@valos/engine`, `React`, `brace`
- exports: `createInspireClient`,
- ValaaSpace: `ValaaScope`, `If`, `ForEach`, `TextFileEditor`
- concepts: `model-view`, `HTML5/CSS/JS`, `rapid devevelopment`


## The promise and the claim

Client-side computation, fully self-referential unified resource
model, fundamentally live UI, full library integrations together with
scalable distributed event sourcing based infrastructure enables
uncompromising, no barrier of entry back-to-the-HTML5/CSS/JS-roots
hyper-rapid but still genuinely sustainable software development.

Let's see if this is true. _o/
