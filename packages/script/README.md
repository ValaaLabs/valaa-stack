# @valos/script extends Javascript with ValaaRAEM as `ValaaScript`

ValaaScript is a semantic, non-syntactic extension of Javascript which
seamlessly integrates Valaa resources with the Javascript object model.
Bridges the gap between Javascript model and ValaaRAEM by considerably
extending the schema. Provides an implementation for ValaaScript via
transpiling into VALK kueries as an intermediate language.
