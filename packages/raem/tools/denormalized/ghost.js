/**
 * Ghost system is a mechanism for prototypically instantiating components in such a manner that
 * updates on the original component and its sub-components' properties will be transparently
 * reflected on the instanced component and its sub-components, 'ghosts', except when such
 * sub/component properties have local modifications.
 *
 * These updates are not limited to just flat immediate leaf member value changes either but new
 * sub-component constructions, destructions and coupling modifications on the prototype parent will
 * be reflected in the instanced component and its ghost sub-components as well.
 *
 * To fully specify the relationship between ghost instantiation and updates we must first define
 * deep copying. A deep copy of an object will recursively copy all sub-components and then update
 * all references inside that instance which point into the object being copied or to any of its
 * sub-components into references to their respective counterparts inside the instance. In other
 * words: the copy is equal in structure and behaviour to the original except for component id's.
 *
 * Ghost instancing emulates deep copying. Any (almost) event log which uses ghost instancing can be
 * trivially mapped into an event log which only uses deep copying so that when a prototypeless ie.
 * flats snapshot are requested they are isomorphic between both event logs. This is done with:
 *
 * Rule of ghost event log isomorphism, ie. 'ghostbuster' rule: If all mutation events against
 * prototypes, ie. of objects that are instantiated anywhere in the event log, are repositioned
 * before said instantiation events themselves and if then all instantiation events are replaced
 * with deep copy events, the resulting object graph shall be isomorphic with the flattened object
 * graph of the original event log.
 *
 * In other words, ghost system behaves so that any prototype mutations are treated as-if they had
 * actually happened before any instantiations of said prototype.
 *
 * Non-validated event logs can be constructed which use ghost instancing and for which this
 * property is not possible: typically (invariably?) this relates to cyclic dependencies such as
 * prototype objects directly referencing their instances. These type of event logs, circular or
 * other, are undefined behaviour as of the initial draft of the ghost system (note: circular
 * systems might have large potential for powerful abstractions such as infinite sets and procedural
 * generators)
 *
 * A ghost is thus defined as a sub-component of an instance component, which acts as a selectively
 * mutable proxy to a corresponding sub-component of the instance prototype component.
 *
 * 1. Ghost id: Resource.id of a ghost is the always deterministic
 *   derivedId(ghostPrototypeId, "instance", instanceId).
 *
 * 2. Ghost prototype: Resource.prototype of the ghost is the proxy target sub-component.
 * The coupled field of the prototype is target sub-component's Resource.materializedGhosts.
 *
 * 3. Ghost partition: Resource.partition of the ghost is the instance component itself.
 * This means that the instance is a transitive Resource.owner of the ghost (directly or through
 * intermediate ghosts). The coupled field of these owner properties is Resource.ghostOwnlings.
 * This ownership tree of the instance component thus initially reflects the ownership tree of the
 * prototype component but might change if the ghosts are mutated.
 *
 * 4. Ghost access: Whenever accessing fields of an instance or any of its sub-component ghosts, all
 * resource id's which belong to the prototype or any of its must be translated (or attempted)
 * into ghost id's of the ghost partition. This makes it possible to use the prototypically accessed
 * id references of original sub-components in conjunction with explicit references to ghost and
 * non-ghost instance sub-components.
 *
 * Initially a ghost is a virtual resource: no creation events need to be made for ghosts. Only
 * when a ghost is mutated will it need to be instantiated. If front-end libraries use accessor
 * wrappers to resource (and they should), they need to observe for such changes to update their
 * references.
