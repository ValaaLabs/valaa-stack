/**
 * VALK - VAlaa Language for Kuerying
 * ==================================
 *
 * VALK Kuery is a generic graph query that can be `run` starting from a value called `head`,
 * with each of the kuery `steps` advancing the head to a new value, with the kuery run returning
 * the value of the final head.
 *
 * ```
 * import V from "@valos/raem/VALK";
 * const to5thDistantCoords = V
 *     .toField("positions")
 *     .filter(V.add(V.to("x"), V.to("y")).greaterThan(10))
 *     .toIndex(5).nullable()
 *     .select(["x", "y"]);
 * ```
 *
 * The corresponding JSON for this Kuery ('VAKON' from hereon, VAlaa Kuery Object Notation) is:
 * ```
 * const to5thDistantCoords = ["$->",
 *   "positions",
 *   ["$filter", ["$>", ["$+", ["x"], ["y"]], 10]],
 *   5, false,
 *   { x: "x", y: "y" },
 * ];
 * ```
 *
 * Running this path kuery results in an object with "x" and "y" fields of the fifth 'positions'
 * entry of myObject which has coordinate sum greater than 10:
 *
 * `expect(run(myObject, to5thDistantCoords)).toEqual({ x: 10, y: 20 });`
 *
 * Or alternatively, the kuery can contain the starting point as a builtin:
 *
 * `expect(run(null, V.fromValue(myObject).toKuery(to5thCoords)).toEqual({ x: 10, y: 20 });`
 *
 * If `myObject` does not have 5 positions objects (ie. the head is undefined after the toIndex(5)
 * step) the result will result in undefined due to nullable()/false short-circuiting it. Normally
 * an operation on an undefined object (here the select) throws an error.
 *
 * Design aims of VALK are to:
 * 1. be a simple, intuitive but still fully expressive and extensible graph query language
 * 2. seamlessly integrate with native javascript object and execution models
 * 3. be fully abstract: kueries are abstract objects and valking engines (see `Valker`) have full
 *   freedom to extend the semantics for their runs.
 *
 * VALK path kueries
 * -----------------
 *
 * const toSillynessAndBeyond = V.to("I").to("am").to("a").to("silly").to("path").to("kuery");
 *
 * The basic building block of VALK is the path Kuery which consists of a sequence of steps.
 * Each step represents a transition from the current head to next head, ie. the head for the next
 * step. The head reached after the last step is the result of the path Kuery.
 *
 * In the above example the 'to' convenience calls add new steps and because Kuery is an immutable
 * structure each 'to' returns the new resulting Kuery. This allows chaining, full composition and
 * reuse of any intermediate Kuery objects if desired.
 *
 * const toIAmUnchanging = V.to("firstPart");
 * const toChain = toIAmUnchanging.to("secondPart");
 *
 * Most of the Kuery convenience functions will add a new path step. This is done by either a
 * adding a new step to the existing path Kuery (returning the new, modified version of it as per
 * immutable rules) or by creating a fully new path Kuery. When creating a new Kuery the whole
 * current Kuery is set as its first step.
 *
 * VALK fields and indices
 * -----------------------
 *
 * const toFieldThenIndex = V.to("values").to(10);
 * const entryIndex = 10;
 * const toSameButDifferent = V.toField("values").toIndex(entryIndex);
 *
 * While any Kuery can be used as a step, the most typical steps are the primitive Kuery's:
 * field lookup and index steps. Valking these expect current head to be an object or an
 * indexable sequence (respectively) and valk to the indicated member or sequence entry as the next
 * head.
 *
 * VALK arrays and objects
 * -----------------------
 *
 * map, filter and find Kuery's can be used to transform sequences by having their sub-Kuery's be
 * applied to the sequence members.
 *
 * VALK expressions
 * ----------------
 *
 * const toSumOfFields = V.fromValue({ a: 1, b: 2 }).add(V.to("a"), V.to("b"));
 *
 * Complex expression Kuery's can be built, such as arithmetic and logical steps. Whenever a
 * an expression step is advanced all of its parameter sub-steps are advanced from the same, shared
 * head. This head is advanced only after the expression itself is evaluated.
 *
 * Unlike other Kuery members the expression convenience functions always return
 * an expression Kuery: They do not extend the existing Kuery with new steps. However if an unary
 * or binary expression is called with too few arguments the existing kuery will be
 * 'subsumed' as the first argument.
 *
 * Complex result sets can be built using select Kuery: all of the values of a select Kuery object
 * are sub-Kueries that get executed. Their results will be placed in object with their
 * corresponding key and this object then is the result of the select. This head is then treated
 * like any other object head and can be accessed with field primitive steps. Especially useful
 * as a head of an expression, as its sub-expressions all start their evaluation from the same head.
 *
 * headType
 * --------
 *
 * VALK Kuery objects can carry type information with them in the form of Kuery.headType(): string.
 * This type information is not translated into JSON form and is used by live Kuery systems.
 * Some steps (like Kuery.toField) allow for specifying the headType directly, but
 * Kuery.setHeadType can be used to set it for any Kuery.
 *
 * naming principles
 * -----------------
 *
 * Steps explicitly described as core steps form the core functionality of VALK. They might
 * also belong to some other categories below.
 *
 * A step prefixed with 'from' (or behaviour described as 'from-step') sets the head while ignoring
 * its current value, has no state or scope side-effects and doesn't valk any arguments. The value
 * is usually read from the scope or state; similar to providing the initial head for run, these are
 * the typical starting points of VALK paths.
 *
 * A step prefixed with 'to' (or behaviour described as a 'to-step') might use the current head to
 * advance to new head but have no direct state or scope side-effects (however their
 * possible arguments might).
 *
 * A step prefixed with 'no' (or behaviour described as a 'no-step') doesn't advance the head, has
 * no scope or graph side effects and doesn't contain sub-steps.
 *
 * A step prefixed with 'do' (or behaviour described as a 'do-step') doesn't advance the head, but
 * has direct state or scope side-effects. These are used for more complex kueries, like script
 * evaluation, scope management and abstraction piercing.
 *
 * Operations explicitly described as host steps make use of the "§<opName>" syntax to access
 * builtin steps. By default they valk all of their arguments against the head eagerly,
 * however some builtin steps explicitly perform lazy evaluation or no evaluation at all.
 *
 * Operations which are none of the above are complex steps built of simpler steps: their
 * arguments are evaluated against head like with builtins.
