# Valaa Prophet

This package is likely the most important sub-package of the whole Valaa architecture. While other
packages provide tools and specifications which enable Valaa, @valos/prophet *defines* Valaa.
The dense definition of Valaa ecosystem is:
  1. All content is stored inside *Valaa Resources*, which live inside
  2. a unified, global, fully cross-connected, immense *ValaaSpace*, which is segmented into
  3. smaller, manageable sized but still connected *Partition*s, each of which is owned by
  4. *Authorities*, which also govern, host and serve those partitions to downstream users via
  5. a distributed network of high-level *Prophet* nodes, which provide the concrete
  6. *PartitionConnection* access points which enable users to access the upstream partitions.

With these concepts this specification aims to implement the distributed event sourcing paradigm
between many independent downstream consumers and many independent upstream authorities
comprehensively, scalably and robustly.

This package also extends the @valos/script schema with Media and Entity. Media is a file-like
content container. Via Prophets and PartitionConnections it allows reading, writing and interpreting
the content. Entity in turn provides directory-like hierarchies for Medias and other Entitys.

This package also extends command/event semantics defined in @valos/core with the concepts of
restricted and universal commands.

This package also provides various Prophet component javascript implementations which can be used to
implement the full valaa application stream gateway inside a client browser. Some of the components
generalize to non-browser contexts, some are fully browser specific.


## 1. Deconstruction of the dense definition

### 1.1. *Valaa Resource*s are the basic building blocks and defined by package schemas

### 1.2. *ValaaSpace* contains everything

### 1.3. *Partition*s allow loading resources and requesting updates selectively

Event sourcing, for all its expressive power and architectural simplicity, has a major glaring
weakness: loading a single resource means loading all other resources in the event log. This is fine
in limited contexts like singular projects of a desktop application. But ValaaSpace as a unified,
global repository is immense. In order to not be useless it cannot be a trivial singular event log.

The Valaa solves this problem with *Partition*s which divide the ValaaSpace into smaller pieces.

#### 1.3.1. Partition rules

##### 1.3.1.1. A Partition contains a single root Entity
This entity is called *the partition root*.

##### 1.3.1.2. All resources owned (even indirectly) by the partition root belong to the partition
Together with the partition root these are called *the partition resources*.

##### 1.3.1.3. Each partition has an event log which contains all the events that modify the partition resources and no other events
Those events have an incrementing serial number *eventId*. Together they form *the partition event log*.

#### 1.3.2. Low coupling and high cohesion rules even more

##### 1.3.2.1. Low coupling saves network bandwidth and CPU ...

When [partitions have low coupling in relation to each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming))
(ie. dependencies between partitions are clear and mostly one-directional) then bandwidth and
computational resources can be saved. Partitions which contain information that is auxiliary to
the application don't need to be loaded before needed. For example a game might have separate areas
be in separate partitions and only start loading the next area when the player is about to finish
the previous one.

##### 1.3.2.2. ... and high cohesion saves time, spares nerves and minimizes overheads

Loading a partition still loads all of its resources. With a sound partition design this is
advantageous. As a corollary to the low coupling above, when
[resources inside a partition have high cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))
(ie. loading one resource means that it is very likely to load the others) it is useful to load them
all together as it spares the network latency and overheads of repeated consequtive requests.

### 1.4. *Authority*s implement the infrastructure and authorize new events for their partitions

### 1.5. *Prophet*s are software components which connect to each other and form information streams

### 1.6. *PartitionConnection* provides an API for accessing an individual partition

Receiving and sending information to a partition is done using a *PartitionConnection*. With the
the Prophet that provided the connection it manages four types of information streams:
  1. commands sent towards upstream
  2. events received towards downstream
  3. media content uploaded to upstream
  4. media content downloaded from upstream


## 2. *Media*s and *Entity*s as files and folders

### 2.3. Media interpretation process

Media interpretation is the process of retrieving content and converting it to a representation that
is useful for users. It is split into three stages: *retrieve* octet stream, *decode* as object
representation and *integrate* in use site context.

#### 2.3.1. Blob *retrieve* yields an ArrayBuffer via network download, cache hit, etc.
Persisted octet sequences are typically identified by their *blobId*, a well-defined content hash of
the whole octet sequence (and nothing else). Their in-memory representation is shared between all
consumers inside the same execution environment.

#### 2.3.2. Content ArrayBuffer is *decoded* into immutable, cacheable object representation based on mime
The octet stream is decoded by decoder plugins associated with the requested mime type into some
runtime object representation. This object representation can range anything from a flat text
decoding, through a complex javascript composite object representation into a full-blown component
with rich, asynchronous API's for accessing the content piece-meal. The requirement is that the
resulting dedoded object must be shareable and reusable between different consumers in unspecified
contexts. This implies that the decoded object should be immutable or provide an immutable API.

##### 2.3.2.1. decoding "application/valaascript"
The application/valaascript decoder transpiles the octet stream into a *module program Kuery*.
This Kuery contains the rules for setting up an ES6-like module exports. The kuery can thus be
shared between different integration contexts (different ghosts of the same base media in different
instances, etc.)

#### 2.3.2.2. decoding "application/javascript"
The application/javascript decoder wraps the octet stream text into a native function.
This function accepts a contextual global scope object as an argument, and when called sets up
an ES6-like module exports based on the octet content interpreted as a javascript module. Like with
other interpretations, this outermost native function will be shared between contexts.

#### 2.3.3. Decoded representation is *integrated* into a specific context

#### 2.3.3.1. integrating "application/valaascript"
When the kuery is valked against a resource and some context the valk result is an object with
ES6-style bindings of the exported symbols as the object properties.

TODO(iridian): Define this precisely. Consult an [analysis of CommonJS and ES Modules within NodeJS](https://medium.com/@giltayar/native-es-modules-in-nodejs-status-and-future-directions-part-i-ee5ea3001f71)
[typescript ESM default interop with CJS](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2719) and
[neufund default export ban](https://blog.neufund.org/why-we-have-banned-default-exports-and-you-should-do-the-same-d51fdc2cf2ad)
[ES6 exports immutable bindings, not values](https://github.com/rauschma/module-bindings-demo)
for some starting inspiration.

#### 2.3.3.2. integrating  "application/javascript"
The contextual global scope for the integration is a javascript global host object associated with
the context resource.


## 3. Only *universal* commands are accepted by the upstream
Restricted commands are commands created by downstream components and which target a particular
partition but for which some of the relevant data is found only in other partitions (such as a
cross-partition DUPLICATED command). Before a restricted command can be sent upstream (from where it
might reach other users which might not even have permissions to access those other partitions) the
command must be *universalized* by explicitly adding all necessary data to the command.


## 4. Concrete components

### 4.1. The *FalseProphet* extends Corpus in-memory store with full connectivity and transactionality

### 4.2. The *Scribe* provides partition content, command queue and event log caching in IndexedDB.

### 4.3. The *Oracle* manages connection information stream routing to authorities and Scribe
