# ValOS style guide

The ValOS style is defined via a union of formal machine readable rules in files listed below and
the informal human readable rules inside comments.
Files specifying formal style rules:
- @valos/toolset-vault/shared/.eslintrc.js
- @valos/toolset-vault/templates/.editorconfig

Note: While ValOS style is formally based on airbnb style in practice it has diverged notably.

## Informal rules

### Formatting non-structured inline documentation in CLI contexts

One of the two options must be used for newlines in individual
documentation pieces:
1. manually line-break with max 71 characters per line.
2. only separate paragraphs and leave line-breaking to the CLI tool.

The tool itself is recommended to be consistent with the choice over
all pieces.
